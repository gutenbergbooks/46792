<h2>THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.</h2>

<p class="center">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fons et Origo Mali.</span></p>

<p>Snugly nestling in a cosy corner of Blankshire&mdash;that county which at
different times and places has travelled all over England&mdash;our village
pursues the even tenor of its way. To be accurate, I should say <i>did</i>
pursue, before the events that have recently happened&mdash;events in which
it would be absurd modesty not to confess I have played a prominent
part. Now we are as full of excitement as aforetime we were given over
to monotony. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Nous avons</i>&mdash;&mdash; No! <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">J'ai changé tout çela.</i></p>

<p>It came about in this way. I have always till the 25th of September (a
chronicler should always be up to dates) been entirely free from any
ambition to excel in public. After a successful life I have settled down
with my wife and family to the repose of a truly rural existence. "You
should come down and live in the country," I am never tired of telling
my friends. "Good air, beautiful milk, and, best of all, fresh eggs." I
don't know why, but you are always expected to praise the country eggs.
So I always make a point of doing it.</p>

<p>Up to September the 25th, accordingly, I extolled the eggs of the
country and lived my simple, unpretending life. On that day I read an
article in the paper on the Parish Councils Act. I read that now for the
first time the people in the villages would taste the sweets of local
self-government. The change from fresh eggs struck my fancy, up to that
time singularly dormant. I read on, dashing all unknowing to my fate.
"It is the duty," I saw, "of every man of education, experience, and
leisure in the village who has the welfare of his country at heart to
study the Act, and to make it his business that his fellow-parishioners
shall know what the Act does, and how the greatest advantage can be
obtained from its working." Then my evil genius prompted me to undertake
the task myself. I was educated&mdash;did I not get a poll degree at
Cambridge, approved even by Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Whibley</span> as a test of culture? I
had experience&mdash;had I not shone as a financial light in the City for
full twenty years? I had leisure&mdash;for had I anything in the world to do?
Obviously the occasion had come, and I&mdash;yes I&mdash;was the man to rise to
it.</p>

<p>I bought twenty-nine works dealing with the Act. I studied them
diligently section by section, clause by clause, line by line. I
referred to all the Acts mentioned. I investigated all the Acts
repealed. At the end of it all I felt like a collection of conundrums.
But I was not to be denied. One evening, as I was walking through the
village, I met <span class="smcap">Robert Hedger</span>, "Black <span class="smcap">Bob</span>," as he is always called. He is
a farm hand, and for some reason looked upon as a leader of men in the
village. I saw my chance, and promptly took it.</p>

<p>"Good evening, <span class="smcap">Bob</span>," I said. "I've been wanting to have a bit of a talk
with you about this Parish Councils Act."</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, and what about that?" Of course he spoke in dialect, but the
dialect dialogues are almost played out, so I translate into quite
ordinary English. It's easier to understand, and quite as interesting.</p>

<p>"What about it?" said I, with well-simulated surprise. Then I launched
into a glowing account of what it would effect. I waxed poetic. The
agricultural labourer would come home at night from his work proud in
the consciousness of being a citizen. He would breathe a different air;
the very fire in his cottage would burn brighter because a Parish
Council had been established in his midst. I finished (it was a distinct
anticlimax) by saying that I had been carefully studying the Act.</p>

<p>Two days later Black <span class="smcap">Bob</span> and two of his mates called at my house&mdash;a
deputation to ask me to speak at a meeting, to explain the Act. I
pleaded modesty, and, saying I would ne'er consent, consented. It was a
vain thing to have done, and the effects have been startling. But that
meeting must have a chapter to itself.</p>

<h2>ROBERT'S SOLLEM ADWISE.</h2>

<p>I carnt on airth think what is the matter with me lately. I seems to
have lost all my good sperrits, and am as quiet and as mopish as if I
was out of a sitiation, which in course I am not, and am not at all
likely to be. My wife bothers me by constent inquiries about the comin
change on the 9th, but she ort to no, as I noes, that the cumming new
<span class="smcap">Lord Mare</span> is jest the same good, kind, afabel Gent as the noble Gent as
is a going afore him, and who ewery body loved and respected, and who
allers showed me ewery posserbel kindness. I aint not at all sure as
them wunderful Gents as calls theirselves County Countsellers, and is
allers a throwing their ill-natured jeers at the grand old Citty, hasn't
sumthink to do with it. I'm told as they has acshally ordered one of our
most poplar Theaters to be shut up, becoz the acters and actresses is so
werry atracktive that they draws a wunderful contrast between them and
the sollem Gents as is allers a interfeering in some way or other where
they are least wanted.</p>

<p>One of their most wunderful and most conceeted fads is a longing desire
to have charge of our nobel Citty Perlice, which, as ewery body knos, is
the pride of the hole Metrolypus.</p>

<div class="figright w25">

</div>

<p>One of the new <span class="smcap">Lord Mare's</span> private gennelmen has told me, in the werry
strictest confidens, that they have all agreed together, <span class="smcap">Lord Mare</span>,
Sherryfs, Halldermen, Liverymen, and setterer, to have the most
brillientest Show as has bin seen in the old Citty since the time of
<span class="smcap">Dick Wittington</span> of ewarlasting memory! if its ony for the purpose of
driving the County Countsellers, as they calls theirselves, stark
staring mad with enwy! And so estonished is the Queen's Guvernment
themselves by what they hears on the subjec of the glorious approching
Dinner, that they has acshally ordered the werry primest of all their
Cabinet lot, inclooding the Prime Minister hisself, and the Lord
Chanceseller, and my Lord <span class="smcap">Spinster</span>, and setterer and setterer, not only
to accept the <span class="smcap">Lord Mare's</span> perlite inwitation, but to take care to be in
good time, and not to keep the nobel company waiting as old Mr.
<span class="smcap">Gledstone</span> usued to do in days gorn by.</p>

<p>By-the-by, the present <span class="smcap">Lord Mare</span>, jest to show his ermazin libberality,
acshally arsked jest a few of the County Countsellers to his larst great
bankwet larst week, and werry much they seemed to injoy theirselves, and
I must say, behaived like reel gennelmen, tho' sum of the speeches,
speshally them by Lord <span class="smcap">Hailsbery</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Richer</span>, must have been rayther
staggerers for them to bear.</p>

<p><i>Acres.</i> Gad, that's true&mdash;I grow full of anger, Sir <span class="smcap">Lucius</span>!&mdash;I fire
apace! Odds hilts and blades! I find a man may have a deal of valour
in him and not know it!... Your words are a grenadier's match to
my heart! I believe courage must be catching! I certainly do feel
a kind of valour rising as it were&mdash;a kind of courage as I may say.&mdash;Odds

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Quite right, <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>. I should have been most seriously
annoyed if I had found that a guest we were all anxiously expecting had
left the Court, owing to some fancied&mdash;&mdash;Where is he now?</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). In&mdash;in the Verney Chamber. Leastways&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Ah. (<i>He glances at</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>.) Then where&mdash;&mdash;? But that can
be arranged. Go up and explain to Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> that we have only this
moment heard of his arrival; say we understand that he has been obliged
to come by a later train, and that we shall be delighted to see him,
just as he is.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). He was worth looking at just as he <i>was</i>,
when <i>I</i> saw him!</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> Very good, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>. (<i>To himself, as he departs.</i>) If I'm not
precious careful over this job, it may cost me my situation!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, I've been thinking that, after what's occurred, it
would probably be more satisfactory to all parties if I shifted my
quarters, and&mdash;and took my meals in the Housekeeper's Room.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> <i>and</i>
Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> <i>utter inarticulate protests</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> My <i>dear</i> Sir, not on any account&mdash;couldn't <i>hear</i> of it! My
wife, I'm sure, will say the same.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>with an effort</i>). I hope Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> will continue to
be our guest precisely as before&mdash;that is, if he will forgive us for
putting him into another room&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It's no use; I
<i>can't</i> get rid of 'em; they stick to me like a lot of highly-bred burrs!
(<i>Aloud, in despair.</i>) Your ladyship is very good, but&mdash;&mdash;Well,
the fact is, I've only just found out that a young lady I've long
been deeply attached to is in this very house. She's a Miss <span class="smcap">Emma
Phillipson</span>&mdash;maid, so I understand, to Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>&mdash;and, without
for one moment wishing to draw any comparisons, or to seem ungrateful
for all the friendliness I've received, I really and truly
would feel myself more comfortable in a circle where I could enjoy
rather more of my <span class="smcap">Emma's</span> society!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>immensely relieved</i>). Perfectly natural! and&mdash;hum&mdash;sorry
as we are to lose you, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, we&mdash;ah&mdash;mustn't
be inconsiderate enough to keep you here a moment longer. I
daresay you will find the young lady in the Housekeeper's
Room&mdash;anyone will tell you where it is.... Good-night to you,
then: and, remember, we shall expect to see you in the field on
Tuesday.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Good-night, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, and&mdash;and I'm so very
glad&mdash;about <span class="smcap">Emma</span>, you know. I hope you will both be very happy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She shakes hands warmly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> So do I. And mind you don't forget about that
liniment, you know.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> don't care a hang! And
I was ass enough to fancy&mdash;&mdash;But there, that's all over now!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene XXVIII.</span>&mdash;<i>The Verney Chamber.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>in the dressing-room, to himself</i>). I wonder how long
I've been locked up here&mdash;it seems hours! I almost hope they've
forgotten me altogether.... Someone has come in.... If it should
be Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>!! Great Heavens, what a situation to be found in
by one's host!... Perhaps it's only that fellow <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>; if so,
there's a chance. (<i>The door is unlocked by</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>, <i>who has
lighted the candles on the dressing-table</i>.) It's the butler again.
Well, I shall soon know the worst! (<i>He steps out, blinking, with as
much dignity as possible</i>.) Perhaps you will kindly inform me why
I have been subjected to this indignity?</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> (<i>in perturbation</i>). I think Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, Sir, in common
fairness, you'll admit as you've mainly yourself to thank for any
mistakes that have occurred; for which I 'asten to express my
pussonal regret.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> So long as you realise that you have made a mistake, I am
willing to overlook it, on condition that you help me to get away
from this place without your master and mistress's knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> It's too late, Sir. They know you're 'ere!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> They know! Then there's no time to be lost. I must leave
this moment!</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> No, Sir, excuse me; but you can't hardly do that <i>now</i>. I was to
say that Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> and the ladies would be glad to see you in the
Droring Room himmediate.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Man alive! do you imagine anything would induce me to meet them
now, after the humiliations I have been compelled to suffer under this
roof?</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> If you would prefer anything that has taken place in the Room,
Sir, or in the stables to be 'ushed up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Prefer it! If it were only possible! But they know&mdash;they <i>know!</i>
What's the use of talking like that?</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I know where I am now! (<i>Aloud.</i>) They know
nothink up to the present, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, nor yet I see no occasion why
they should&mdash;leastwise from any of <i>Us</i>.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> But they know I'm here; how am I to account for all the time&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> Excuse me. Sir. I thought of that, and it occurred to me as it
might be more agreeable to your feelings, Sir, if I conveyed an
impression that you had only just arrived&mdash;'aving missed your train,
Sir.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>overjoyed</i>). How am I to thank you? that was really most
discreet of you&mdash;most considerate!</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> I am truly rejoiced to hear you say so, Sir. And I'll take care
nothing leaks out. And if you'll be kind enough to follow me to the
Droring Room, the ladies are waiting to see you.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I may actually meet Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie Mull</span> after all!
(<i>Aloud, recollecting his condition</i>.) But I can't go down like this.
I'm in such a horrible mess!</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> I reelly don't perceive it, Sir; there's a little white on your
coat-collar behind. Allow me&mdash;there, it's off now. (<i>He gives him a
hand-glass.</i>) If you'd like to see for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself as he looks</i>). A little pallor, that's all. I am
more presentable than I could have hoped. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Have the
kindness to take me to Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> at once.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene XXIX.</span>&mdash;<i>The Chinese Drawing Room.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>A few minutes later.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, <i>after the introductions have been gone
through</i>). And so you missed the 4.55 and had to come on by the 7.30,
which stops everywhere, eh?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> It&mdash;it certainly does stop at most stations.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> And how did you get on to Wyvern&mdash;been here long?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> N-not <i>particularly</i> long.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Fact is, you see, we made a mistake. Very ridiculous,
but we've been taking that young fellow, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, for
<i>you</i>, all this time; so we never thought of inquiring whether
you'd come or not. It was only just now he told us how he'd
met you in the Verney Chamber, and the very handsome way,
if you will allow me to say so, in which you had tried to efface
yourself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I didn't expect him to take <i>that</i> view of it!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I felt I had no alternative.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> <i>regards him with admiration</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> You did an uncommon fine thing, Sir, and I'm afraid
you received treatment on your arrival which you had every right to
resent.</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I hoped he didn't know about the Housekeeper's
Room! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Please say no more about it, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>. I know
now that you were entirely innocent of any&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> (<i>horrified</i>). Good Gad! you didn't suppose <span class="smcap">I</span> had any
hand in fixing up that booby trap, or whatever it was, did you?
Young fellows will get bear-fighting and playing idiotic tricks on one
another, and you seem to have been the victim&mdash;that's how it was.
Have you had anything to eat since you came? If not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Thank you, I&mdash;I <i>have</i> dined. (<i>To himself.</i>) So
he <i>doesn't</i> know where, after all! I will spare him <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rup.</i> Got some food at Shuntingbridge, eh? Afraid they
gave you a wretched dinner?</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Quite the reverse, I assure you. (<i>To himself.</i>) Considering
that it came from his own table!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>in an undertone, to</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>). <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>,
you remember what I said some time ago&mdash;about poetry and poets?</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Perfectly. And I thought you were quite right.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I was quite <i>wrong</i>. I didn't know what I was talking
about. I do now. Good night. (<i>She crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.)
Good night, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>, I'm so very glad we have met&mdash;at last!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She goes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Und.</i> (<i>to himself, rapturously</i>). She's <i>not</i> freckled; she's not even
sandy. She's lovely! And, by some unhoped for good fortune, all
this has only raised me in her eyes. I am more than compensated!</p>

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I may just as well get back to Aldershot
to-morrow&mdash;<i>now</i>. I'll go and prepare Lady C.'s mind, in case.
It's hard luck; just when everything seemed goin' right! I'd give
somethin' to have the other bard back, I know. It's no earthly use
my tryin' to stand against <i>this</i> one!</p>

<h2>FEMINA DUX FACTI.</h2>

<p class="author">
<i>The Tumulus, Parliament Hill, Nov. 5.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Do not confuse me with a boa-constrictor
story. Cursed be he that disturbs my <i>bona fides</i>; and the above is
my real address.</p>

<p>True, the ancient Romans knew me as the Old Pretendress, but
let that pass. What I want to know is this. Will <i>nothing</i> check
the energy of the L. C. C.?&mdash;nothing allay their fever for expurgation?
I am not a Promenader. I only ask to lie still. Nor a Living
Picture either, and have not been for more than eighteen centuries.
Talk of Roman noses! Why their eagle was a chicken compared
with the London Carrion Crows! Such a power of scent!</p>

<p>It is Guy Fawkes day, and I hear talk of blowing up the Lords.
But surely one must draw the line somewhere this side of an insidious
exhumation of the Monarchy!</p>

<p>After all, if they do get at my bones, the real marrow of me has
transmigrated into the New Woman. Sir, there <i>were</i> New Women
in my day. We invented everything. I see the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
says they have found a pellet. That reminds me that after the
death of my late husband, <span class="smcap">Prasutagus</span>, King of the Iceni (not to be
confused with the <span class="smcap">Plioceni</span> of about the same period), I was subjected
to the most revolting barbarity at the hands of the Veterans (their
name was legionary), and I was obliged to invent a pellet-proof
corset.</p>

<p>Then, again, we held all the commissions in the army. How does
<span class="smcap">Tacitus</span> report my famous speech to the Queen Consort's Own
Regiment of Pioneers (new style)? "<i>Vincendum illa acie vel cadendum
esse. Id mulieri destinatum. Viverent viri et servirent.</i>" Let
the men live on in slavery! What a prophetic utterance!</p>

<p>By the way, not many Emancipated Women of the present day
could speak better Latin than that. Indeed, we took all the
University degrees. I myself was an honorary <i>felo de se</i>.</p>

<p>Don't tell me that I am prehistoric, and that <span class="smcap">Tacitus</span> was a forger
of the fourteenth century. No testimony is sacred now-a-days, not
even the most profane!</p>

<p>I conclude with a passage from Madame <span class="smcap">Sarah Gray</span>, which I
think comes in rather well.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beneath this storied hump there lies concealed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A heart once pregnant with a Righteous Plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hands that the rod of Empire used to wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And whacked to ecstasy the human Man.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, may you live for ever; or, failing that, may no
rude spoiler mar your "animated bust." Excuse these disjointed
remarks, but I am writing in a barrow.</p>

<p class="i30">Yours, in the spirit,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Boadicea</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I have thought of a proverb. New Women should be put
into new <i>tumuli</i>.</p>

<h2>A GAY WIDOW COURTED.</h2>

<div class="figleft w25">
<a href="images/221a.png">
<img src="images/221a.png"
alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Nothing could be better than the acting all round in the new three-act
play at the Court. It is distinctly first-rate, and those who want a
hearty laugh should proceed to the Court to enjoy it. And yet there is
also serious relief, as there should be&mdash;light and shade. First there is
Miss <span class="smcap">Lottie Venne</span>, who shows us that she can mingle pathos with comedy,
temper smiles with tears. She is as bright as sunshine in the comic
scenes, and when she has to say good-bye to her newly-married daughter,
she glides from peals of merriment into sobs of sorrow that are
intensely touching because they are intensely natural. Then Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawtrey</span>,
in a part that fits him down to the ground (in the Stalls) and up to the
ceiling (in the Gallery), is greatly amusing. And he, too, has his more
mournful moments. People accustomed to seeing this accomplished actor in
butterfly touch-and-go parts would scarcely credit him with the power of
becoming pathetically unmanned. And yet so it is. Mr. <span class="smcap">Hawtrey</span>, indignant
at a false accusation emanating from his wife, commences a letter full
of angry reproaches, addressed to her solicitors, and gradually forgets
everything in his despairing appeal for the love he craves but which he
fears he has lost. Nothing better than this has been seen for a long
time in a London theatre. Then Mr. <span class="smcap">Gilbert Hare</span> (inheritor of his
father's cleverness) causes roars of laughter by his comical sketch of a
man with a cold. But here, again, the mirth is tempered with sympathy.
The echo of the "ha, ha, ha," in spite of its inappropriateness, is
"Poor fellow!" Mr. <span class="smcap">Thorne</span>, too, is good, and so is Mr. <span class="smcap">Righton</span>, and so
is everyone concerned.</p>

shot at a pun whenever the chance is given him, "then its title
should of course be '<i>Manon Bur-Lescaut</i>.'"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reform in Conveyancing.</span>"&mdash;Certainly, a reform much needed.
Let us have some new Hansoms which are not "bone-shakers" and
whose windows will not act as so many guillotines. Some improved
growlers (they have been a bit better recently), drawn by less
dilapidated horses, would be a welcome addition.

<h2>THE DECADENT GUYS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Colour-Study in Green Carnations.</i>)</p>

<p>They were sitting close together in their characteristic attitudes;
the knees slightly limp, and the arms hanging loosely by their sides;
Lord <span class="smcap">Raggie Tattersall</span> in the peculiar kind of portable chair he
most affected; <span class="smcap">Fustian Flitters</span> in a luxurious sort of handbarrow.
The lemon-tinted November light of a back street in a London
slum floated lovingly on their collapsed forms, and on the great mass of
weary cabbage-stalks that lay dreaming themselves daintily to death
in the gutter at their feet.</p>

<p>They were both dressed very much alike, in loosely-fitting, fantastically
patched coats. Lord <span class="smcap">Raggie</span> was wearing a straw hat,
with the crown reticently suggested rather than expressed, which
suited his complexion very well, emphasising, as it did, the white
weariness of his smooth face, with the bright spot of red that had
appeared on each cheek, and the vacant fretfulness of his hollow
eyes; he held his head slightly on one side, and seemed very tired.
<span class="smcap">Fustian Flitters</span> had adopted the regulation chimney-pot hat,
beautiful with the iridescent sheen of decay; he was taller, bulgier,
and bulkier than his friend, and allowed his heavy chin to droop
languidly forward. Both wore white cotton gloves, broken boots,
and rather small magenta cauliflowers in their button-holes.</p>

<p>"My dear <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>," said Mr. <span class="smcap">Flitters</span>, in a gently elaborate voice, and
with a gracious wave of his plump straw-distended white fingers towards
his companion's chair; "you are looking very well this afternoon. You
would be perfectly charming in a red wig and a cocked-hat, and a checked
ulster with purple and green shadows in the folds. You would wear it
beautifully, floating negligently over your shoulders. But you are
wonderfully complete as you are!"</p>

<p>"That is so true!" acquiesced <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>, with perfect complacency. "I am
very beautiful. And you, <span class="smcap">Fustian</span>, you are so energetically inert. Are
you going to blow up to-night? You are so brilliant when you blow up."</p>

<p>"I have not decided either way. I never do. It will depend upon how I
feel in the bonfire. I let it come if it will. The true <i>impromptu</i> is
invariably premeditated."</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather self-contradictory?"
said <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>, with his pretty quick smile.</p>

<p>"Of course it is. Does not consistency solely consist in contradicting
oneself? But I suppose I <i>am a trifle décousu</i>."</p>

<p>"You are. Indeed, we are both what those absurd clothes-dealing
Philistines would call 'threadbare'&mdash;you and I."</p>

<p>"I hope so, most sincerely. There is something so hopelessly
middle-class about wearing perfectly new clothes. It always reminds me
of that ridiculous Nature, who will persist in putting all her poor
little trees into brand-new suits of hideous non-arsenical green every
spring. As if withered leaves, or even nudity itself, would not really
be infinitely more decent! I detest a coat that is what the world calls
a 'fit!'"</p>

<p>"Clothes that fit," observed Lord <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>, gravely, "are the natural
penalty for possessing that dreadful deformity, a good figure. Only
exploded mediocrities like <span class="smcap">Tupper</span> and <span class="smcap">Bunn</span> and <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> ought to have
figures."</p>

<p>"<i>Had</i> <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> a figure? I thought it was only a bust."</p>

<p>"We shall have <i>our</i> little bust by and by, I suppose," said <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>,
pensively. "I wonder <i>when</i>. I feel in the mood to sally forth and
paint the night with strange scarlet, slashed with silver and gold,
while our young votaries&mdash;beautiful pink boys in paper hats&mdash;let off
marvellous pale epigrammatic crackers and purple paradoxical squibs
in our honour."</p>

<p>"See, <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>, here come our youthful disciples! Do they not
look deliciously innocent and enthusiastic? I wish, though, we
could contrive to imbue them with something of our own lovely
limpness&mdash;they are so atrociously lively and active."</p>

<p>"That will come, <span class="smcap">Fustian</span>," said Lord <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>, indulgently.
"We must give them time. Already they have copied our distinctive
costume, caught our very features and colouring. Some day,
<span class="smcap">Fustian</span>, some day they will adopt our mystic emblem&mdash;the symbol
that is such a true symbol in possessing no meaning whatever&mdash;the
Magenta Cauliflower! And then&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;It will be time for Us to drop it," continued Mr. <span class="smcap">Fustian
Flitters</span>, with his peculiar smile of inscrutable obviousness.</p>

<p>"Beautiful rose-coloured children!" murmured Lord <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>,
dreamily; "how sad to think that they will all grow up and degenerate
into pork-butchers, and generals, and bishops, and absurdly futile persons
of that sort! But listen; it is so sweet of them&mdash;they are going to
sing an exquisite little catch I composed expressly for them, a sort of
mellifluously raucous chant with no tune in particular. That is
where it is so wonderful. True melody is always quite tuneless!"</p>

<p>One by one the shrill, passionate young voices chimed in, until the
very lamp-posts throbbed and rang with the words, and they seemed to
wander away, away among the sleeping pageant of the chimney-pots,
away to the burnished golden globes of the struggling pawnbroker.</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Lord <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>, with his head bent, listened with a smile parting the
scarlet thread of his lips, a smile in his pretty hollow eyes. "I wonder
why people should be exhorted to remember such a prosaic and commonplace
crime as that," he meditated aloud: "a crime, too, that had not even the
vulgar merit of being a success!"</p>

<p>"Only failures ever <i>do</i> succeed, really," said <span class="smcap">Fustian</span>, leaning largely
over his barrow. "How deliciously they are joggling us! Don't you like
having your innermost shavings stimulated, <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>?"</p>

<p>"There is only one stimulating thing in the world," was the languid
answer; "and that is a soporific. But see, <span class="smcap">Fustian</span>, here comes one of
those unconsciously absurd persons they call policemen. How stiffly he
holds himself. Why is there something so irresistibly ludicrous about
every creature that possesses a spine? Perhaps because to be vertebrate
is to be normal, and the normal is necessarily such a hideous
monstrosity. I love what are called warped distorted figures. The only
real Adonis nowadays is a Guy." And the shrill voices of the young
choristers, detaching themselves one by one from the melodic fabric in
which they were enmeshed, grew fainter and fainter still&mdash;until they
slipped at last into silence. "<span class="smcap">Fustian</span>, did you notice? Our rose-white
adherents have abandoned us. They have run away&mdash;'done a guy,' as
vulgarians express it."</p>

<p>"They have done <i>two</i>," said Mr. <span class="smcap">Flitters</span> correctively; "which
only proves the absolute sincerity of their devotion. Is not the whole
art of fidelity comprised in knowing exactly when to betray?"</p>

<p>"How original you are to-day, <span class="smcap">Fustian</span>! But what is this crude
blue copper going to do with you and me? Can we be going to
become notorious&mdash;<i>really</i> notorious&mdash;at last?"</p>

<p>"I devoutly trust not. Notoriety is now merely a synonym for
respectable obscurity. But he certainly appears to be engaged in
what a serious humourist would call 'running us in.'"</p>

<p>"How pedantic of him! Then shan't we be allowed to explode at
all this evening?"</p>

<p>"It seems not. They think we are dangerous. How can one
tell? Perhaps we are. Give me a light, <span class="smcap">Raggie</span>, and I will be brilliant
for you alone. Come, the young Shoeblack bends to his brush, and
the pale-faced Coster watches him in his pearly kicksies; the
shadows on the mussels in the fish-stall are violet, and the vendor
of halfpenny ices is washing the spaces of his tumblers with primrose
and with crimson. Let me be brilliant, dear boy, or I feel that I
shall burst for sheer vacuity, and pass away, as so many of us have
passed, with all my combustibles still in me!"</p>

<p>And with gentle resignation, as martyrs whose apotheosis is merely
postponed, Lord <span class="smcap">Raggie</span> and <span class="smcap">Fustian Flitters</span> allowed themselves
to be slowly moved on by the rude hand of an unsympathetic Peeler.

<h2>THE POLITE GUIDE TO THE CIVIL SERVICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By an Affable Philosopher and
Courteous Friend.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Choice of a Private Secretary.</span></p>

<p>Having explained the mode of entering the
service of the Crown by becoming the Secretary
of the Public Squander Department, I
now proceed to consider the best manner in
which you should comport yourself in that
position. The moment it is known that you
have accepted the appointment you will receive
a deluge of letters recommending various
aspiring young gentlemen for the post of
Private Secretary. Of course the notes must
be civilly answered, but on no account pledge
yourself to any one of the writers. And here
I may give what may be termed the golden
rule of the service, "always be polite to the
individual in particular, and contemptuous to
the public in general." The tradition of
many generations of officials has been to regard
outsiders as enemies. There may be
small jealousies in a Government Department,
but every man in the place will stand
shoulder to shoulder with his fellow to repel
the attacks of non-civilians. And the word
"attack" has many meanings. Practically,
everything is an attack. If an outsider asks
a question, the query is an attack. If an outsider
complains, the grievance is an attack.
If an outsider begs a favour, the petition is
an attack. If you bear this well in mind,
you cannot go wrong. Adopt it as your
creed, and you may be sure that you will
became immediately an ideal head of a
Government Department.</p>

<p>Say that you have accepted your appointment,
and are prepared to take up at once the
duties appertaining to your new position.
No doubt during your "attacks" upon the
Milestones you will have come across several
of the officials of the Public Squander Department.
So when you arrive in the hall of your
new bureau you will be recognised at once
by most of the messengers. You will be conducted
with deference to your new quarters.
You will find them very comfortable. Any
number of easy-chairs. Large writing-desk.
Several handsome tables. Rich carpet, rugs
to match, and a coal-scuttle with the departmental
cypher. On the walls, maps and
some armour. The latter, no doubt, has
come from the Tower, or Holyrood, or Dublin
Castle. Most probably one of your predecessors
has given an official dinner in your
room, and the armour is the result of the
importunity of his Private Secretary.</p>

<p>"I say, <span class="smcap">Tenterfore</span>," your predecessor
has observed, "don't you think these walls
are a bit bare? Don't you think you could
get them done up a bit?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sir," <span class="smcap">Tenterfore</span> has replied,
and the result of his energy has been the
trophies you see around you. <span class="smcap">Tenterfore</span>
has applied to the people at the Tower, or
Holyrood, or Dublin Castle, and got up quite
a collection of quaint old arms. They have
been duly received by the Public Squander
Department, and retained. It is a rule of
the <i>bureau</i> that anything that has been once
accepted shall be kept for ever. That is to
say, if it can be clearly proved that the things
retained can be useful somewhere else. You
look round with satisfaction, and then greet
with effusion the chief clerk. He has been
waiting to receive you. As you do not know
the ropes, it is advisable to be civil to every
one. Later on, when you have a talented
assistant to prompt you, you can allow your
cordiality to cool. However, at this moment
it is better to be extremely polite to all the
world, and (if you know her) his wife. The
chief clerk is delighted to exchange expressions
of mutual respect and common good-will.
He will put in something neat about
the Milestones as a concession to your labours
in that direction.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir," you will reply with a
smile, "don't bother yourself about <i>them</i>. I
can keep <i>them</i> quite safe. We have nothing
to fear from them."</p>

<p>The face of the chief clerk will beam. He
will see that you are one of them. Milestones
for the future are to be defended, not attacked.
He will accept you as an illustrious bureaucratic
recruit. He will see that you are ready
to stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of the
office. Could anything be better?</p>

<p>Then for about the thirtieth time you will
be asked if you have selected a private secretary,
and the chief clerk will suggest his own
particular nominee. With much cordiality
you will receive the proposal, but keep the
matter open. You must remember that upon
the appointment your future success depends.
Moreover, it is a nice little piece of patronage
which you may as well retain for yourself.</p>

<p>When you have selected your private secretary
it will be time to get into harness, and
of this operation I hope to treat on some
future occasion.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<div class="figleft w25">
<a href="images/228a.png">
<img src="images/228a.png"
alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><i>Gleams of Memory; with Some Reflections</i>, is the happy title of Mr.
<span class="smcap">James Payn's</span> last book, published by <span class="smcap">Smith and Elder</span>. The wit of the
title flashes through every page of the single volume. Within its modest
limits of space will be found not only some of the best stories of the
day, but stories the best told. Not a superfluous word spoils the gems,
which have been ruthlessly taken out of their setting and spread
widecast through the circulation of many newspapers reviewing the work.
My Baronite, fortunately, has not space at his disposal to join in this
act of flat, though seductive, burglary. He advises everyone to go to
the book itself. The reader will find himself enjoying the rare
privilege of intimacy with a cultured mind, and a heart so kindly that
temptation to say smart things at the expense of others, which underlies
the possession of overflowing humour, is resisted, apparently without
effort. Like the German Emperor or Mr. <span class="smcap">Justin Mccarthy</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Payn</span>
probably "could be very nasty if he liked." He doesn't like, and is
therefore himself liked all the better.</p>

<p>That little tale entitled <i>The Black Patch</i>, by <span class="smcap">Gertrude Clay
Ker-Seymer</span>, introduces to the public a rather novel character in the
person of a <i>Miss Clara Beauchamp</i> an amateur female detective, to
whom <span class="smcap">Sherlock Holmes</span>, when he chooses to "come out of his
ambush," (for no one believes he fell over that precipice and was killed
about a year ago,) ought at once to propose. It would be an excellent
firm. <span class="smcap">Clara</span> would make our <span class="smcap">Holmes</span> happy, and a certain advertising
medicine provider bearing the same name as the heroine of this sporting
story would have another big chance of increasing his "hoardings."
The Baron, skilled as he is in plots, owns to having been now
and again puzzled over this one which clever <span class="smcap">Clara</span> the Clearer soon
makes apparent to everybody. The story is a working out of the
description of twins, how "each is so like both that you can't tell
t'other from which." But mind you, not ordinary biped twins&mdash;oh
dear no&mdash;they are.... No ... the Baron respects a lady's secret,
and recommends the inquisitive to get the book and penetrate the
mystery.</p>

<p>To all those who like a mystery, and who gratefully remember
<span class="smcap">Florence Warden's</span> <i>House on the Marsh</i>, let the Baron recommend
<i>A Perfect Fool</i>, by the same authoress. Dickensian students will be
struck by the fact of a "<i>Mr. Dick</i>" being kept on the premises. He is a
caged Dickie, poor chap; but, like his ancestor the original <i>Mr. Dick</i>,
he sets everybody right at last. The Baron dare not say more, lest
he should let the Dickie out of the cage. The only disappointment,
to old-fashioned novel-readers, at least, who love justice to be done,
and the villain to receive worse than he has given, is in the moral of
the tale; yet in these decadent Yellow Asterical and Green Carnational
days it is as good as can be wished. <span class="smcap">Florence Warden</span>
is neither priggish nor Church-Wardenish; and so, when the scoundrel&mdash;&mdash;But
here, again, the Baron must put his finger to his lips,
and ask you to read the story; when, and not till then, he may
imagine whether you do not agree with him, "<i>Mystère!</i>"</p>

<p>Curiosity has ever been a weakness of human nature, and that
seems to be the only reason why so many make themselves uncomfortable
by taking journeys to the Pole. Imitating <span class="smcap">Nansen</span>,
<span class="smcap">Gordon Stables, M.D., R.N.</span>, sends his hero <i>To Greenland and the
Pole</i>, which he reaches after much "skilöbning" (the book must be
read to grasp its meaning), and receiving a chilly but polite welcome,
with the arrogance of an Englishman breaks the cold silence by
singing the "<i>National Anthem</i>," when of course the Pole is thawed
at once!</p>

<p>Writes a Baronitess Junior, "Those little boys and girls who delight
in fairy lore will find a charming story of magical adventures
in <i>Maurice; or, the Red Jar</i>, by the Countess of <span class="smcap">Jersey</span>, or more
appropriately Countess of <span class="smcap">J<i>a</i>rsey</span>. It is fantastically illustrated by
<span class="smcap">Rosie M. M. Pitman</span>, and published by <span class="smcap">Macmillan &amp; Co.</span>, and
shows how unpleasant a jar can be in a family. And yet has not
the poet finely said, 'A thing of beauty is a Jar for ever!'"</p>

<p>The Baron is anxiously expecting the appearance from The
Leadenhall Press of Mr. <span class="smcap">Tuer's</span> <i>Chap-book</i>. Of course, all "the
Chappies" from "Chap 1" to "Last Chap" are on the look out for
it. The Baron fancies it will be a perfect fac-simile, and if not perfect,
the merciful critic who is merciful to his author will say with
the poet <span class="smcap">Pope</span></p>

<p class="center">"<i>Tu er</i> is human,"</p>

<p class="noid">which is a most pope-ular quotation; while as to the latter half of
the line "to forgive, divine"&mdash;that, in a measure, is one of the unstrained
prerogatives of the</p>
